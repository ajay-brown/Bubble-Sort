# Bubble-Sort

This is a repo containing various sorting algorithms. 

The bubble sort function takes in an array of numbers and sorts them using the bubble sort algorithm. It works using two for loops. The first loops starts at the end of the given array of numbers and the second loops starts at the beginning. The higher number is assigned to a moving variable that is compared to each of the numbers in the array. A higher number will go further down the array until it is sorted. 

The quick sort function takes in an array of numbers and sorts them using the quick sort algorithm
